# Air Quality Index (AQI) Prediction & Forecasting for Indian Cities

## ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement
Air pollution is a critical health hazard in Indian cities.  
This project analyzes historical air quality data to:
1. Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA).
2. Predict AQI values (regression).
3. Classify air quality categories (Good, Moderate, Poor, etc.).
4. (Future milestone) Forecast AQI for 7 days ahead.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset
- **Source:** [Air Quality Data in India (2015â€“2024)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohanrao/air-quality-data-in-india)  
- Includes pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, NOâ‚‚, SOâ‚‚, CO, Oâ‚ƒ) and AQI across Indian cities.

## ðŸš€ Workflow Plan
1. **Week 1 (30%) â€“ EDA**  
   - Load dataset, handle missing values, visualize trends, correlations, and seasonality.  
2. **Week 2 (60%) â€“ Modeling**  
   - Train baseline models (Regression & Classification).  
   - Evaluate with RMSE/MAE and F1-score.  
3. **Week 3/Final (100%)**  
   - Forecast AQI (Prophet/LSTM).  
   - Deployment with Streamlit dashboard.  
   - Submit final report & PPT.
